RandomForestClassifier ?\n","* Rép : **Random Forest Classifier** est un algorithme d'apprentissage ensembliste populaire utilisé pour les tâches de classification. Il est basé sur le concept de l'arbre de décision, où plusieurs arbres de décision sont entraînés sur différents sous-échantillons des ensembles de données et leurs prédictions sont combinées pour faire la prédiction finale.\n"," 1. **Échantillonnage Bootstrap (bagging)** : Le Random Forest commence par créer plusieurs arbres de décision, chacun étant entraîné sur un sous-ensemble aléatoire des données d'entraînement. Ce processus est appelé échantillonnage bootstrap.\n"," 2. **Randomisation des Caractéristiques** : En plus d'entraîner chaque arbre sur un sous-ensemble aléatoire des données, le Random Forest sélectionne également un sous-ensemble aléatoire de caractéristiques à considérer lors de la division de chaque nœud de l'arbre. Cela introduit plus de randomisation dans le modèle et aide à décorréler les arbres.\n"," 3. **Vote** : Une fois que tous les arbres sont entraînés, des prédictions sont faites par chaque arbre individuel. Pour les tâches de classification, chaque arbre vote pour l'étiquette de classe qu'il prédit. L'étiquette de classe avec le plus de votes est choisie comme prédiction finale.\n"," * **Efficace** parce que :\n","   1. **Robustesse** : Le Random Forest est moins sujet au surapprentissage par rapport aux arbres de décision individuels car il combine les prédictions de plusieurs arbres, chacun étant entraîné sur un sous-ensemble différent des données.\n","   2. **Gestion des Données Déséquilibrées** : Le Random Forest est une mesure de l'importance des caractéristiques, ce qui peut aider à comprendre l'importance relative des différentes caractéristiques dans la réalisation des prédictions.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Performance Metrics\n","* Qu'est-ce que les Performance Metrics ?\n","* Rép : Ce sont des métriques utilisées comme base pour calculer la performance de notre modèle sur les données fournies.

Chaque composant du pipeline se concentre sur une tâche spécifique, ce qui permet de comprendre et de gérer plus facilement l'ensemble du processus.\n","  2. **Automatisation** : Le pipeline automatise le processus d'application de multiples transformations aux données de manière séquentielle. Au lieu d'appliquer manuellement chaque transformation une par une, vous pouvez définir un pipeline qui encapsule toutes les étapes de prétraitement et l'appliquer ensuite aux données en une seule fois.\n","  3. **Reproductibilité** : Le pipeline garantit que la même séquence d'étapes de prétraitement est appliquée de manière cohérente à différents ensembles de données ou sous-ensembles de données. Cela améliore la reproductibilité de vos expériences de machine learning et facilite la comparaison de différents modèles ou ensembles de données.\n","  4. **Évolutivité** : Le pipeline peut être facilement étendu ou modifié pour intégrer de nouvelles étapes de prétraitement ou de nouveaux modèles selon les besoins.
